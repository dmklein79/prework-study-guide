# prework-study-guide

## An outline of what I learned during the pre-work phase of Coding Bootcamp

What this is: a first, introductory web application developed over the course of several modules, as a primer for coding bootcamp. We do this to hit the ground running, because we want to maximize the time we have together. In this web application we utilized elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also learning how to deploy our remote code to a team-based Github environment.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains notes about the specific topic (HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git). If you open the console, you can see JavaScript being run in the background; it will list the topics we learned and randomly choose a topic to learn first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
